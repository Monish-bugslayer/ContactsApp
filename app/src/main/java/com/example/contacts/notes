Permission are two types:
runtime invokes a permission during runtime
install time permission gets access to a permission while installing the app
    normal permission level
    signature permission level

special permission :A special permission guards access to system resources
that are particularly sensitive or not directly related to user privacy.

exmaple of special permission
Scheduling exact alarms.
Displaying and drawing over other apps.
Accessing all storage data.

why we use permissions
Control: The user has control over the data that they share with apps.
Transparency: The user understands what data an app uses and why the app accesses this data.
Data minimization: An app accesses and uses only the data that's required for a specific task or action that the user invokes.
